# 9. Initiate a Withdrawal From Layer 2 Back to Layer 1

Withdrawing an asset from [Layer 2](../conceptual-explainers/structure.md#layer-1-layer-2) back to [Layer 1](../conceptual-explainers/structure.md#layer-1--layer-2) is another step in the roundtrip process of interoperability. [Godwoken](../conceptual-explainers/frameworks.md#godwoken) is a Layer 2 that is a natural extension of Layer 1, so it has deep integration which allows it to function seamlessly using a built-in withdrawal mechanism.

Deposits from Layer 1 to Layer 2 are quick. This is because Layer 1 has stronger security than Layer 2. When a deposit is made to Layer 2, it can reliably trust Layer 1 after waiting for only a few confirmations. However, a withdrawal is the opposite. When a withdrawal is made to Layer 1, it must rely on Layer 2, which inherently has lower security. For this reason, the number of confirmations required is much higher in order to guarantee that the security remains reliable. It takes approximately five days from the start of the withdrawal process to the point where funds are actually released on Layer 1.

This long withdrawal duration may seem exceptionally long, but it is a necessary step at this stage. Godwoken uses an optimistic rollup architecture that only allows a single honest node in the network. This provides an exceptionally secure basis for Layer 2, but the tradeoff is that it requires a "challenge period" when exiting from Layer 2. This is a period where Layer 2 network operators have time to check and raise issues with any potentially malicious transactions and rollback if necessary. The safety of the network is the first concern. Network parameters may be changed in the future, but only after it has been proven to be safe. It is also possible that other solutions will be created in the future to allow for faster exits from Layer 2.

## Task Instructions

In this task you will use Godwoken Examples tool package to execute the `withdraw` command using `account-cli.js`. This is the first part of the withdrawal process, and the funds must still undergo a five day waiting period before they are unlocked and released. To complete this task, you must issue the `withdraw` command to start the process. You will still have to wait five days before unlocking to complete the process, but this second part has been split into the next task.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin on this task you must complete the [first task](1.create.godwoken.account.md) to create a Godwoken account on the EVM Layer 2 Testnet. You will also need the private key and Testnet address from the first task in order to proceed. If you have not completed it, please do so now.

You can find setup instructions for Godwoken Examples Tools Package [here](../component-tutorials/3.setup.and.use.account.cli.md#setup-the-godwoken-examples-tools-package).

### 1. Execute the Withdraw Command

Using the Godwoken Examples tool package, execute the `withdraw` command using the command below, replacing values as needed.

```
cd godwoken-examples
node ./packages/tools/lib/account-cli.js withdraw -r <INSERT_TESTNET_RPC_URL> -p <YOUR_ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY> -o <YOUR_LAYER_1_ADDRESS> -c <SHANNONS_AMOUNT>
```

1. `<INSERT_TESTNET_RPC_URL>` - The RPC URL of the Testnet CKB node you will use. This should be your local address if you are using a local node, or it can be a public address if you're using a public node.\
   Local Testnet CKB Node URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8114`\
   Public Testnet CKB Node URL: `http://3.235.223.161:18114`
2. `<YOUR_ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY>` - This is your Ethereum private key for the Layer 2 account that contains the CKBytes which were deposited previously. **Always make sure your private key is prefixed with "0x".**
3. `<YOUR_LAYER_1_ADDRESS>` - The Nervos CKB Layer 1 address for your account on Layer 1. This will be used to receive funds from Layer 2. If you used `ckb-cli` to generate your accounts, you can view them using the `account list` command.
4. `<SHANNONS_AMOUNT>` - The amount of CKBytes to transfer, written in Shannons. A Shannon is a unit of measurement in Nervos that is the equivalent of a Satoshi in Bitcoin. We recommend depositing 400 CKBytes, which is the minimum number required by Godwoken. There are 100,000,000 Shannons in a CKByte, and this value must be expressed in Shannons. ie: 400 \* 100,000,000 = 40,000,000,000

Example final command with all the values filled in:

```
cd godwoken-examples
node ./packages/tools/lib/account-cli.js withdraw -r http://3.235.223.161:18114 -p 0xd9066ff9f753a1898709b568119055660a77d9aae4d7a4ad677b8fb3d2a571e5 -o ckt1qyq9u5vzgtklnqrr6cevra7w2utrsxmjgefs72sfju -c 40000000000
```

If you see _"Success! Withdrawal request sent. You need to wait now for challenge period duration to unlock the funds."_ message at the end it means you have successfully initiated a withdrawal process. Congratulations, you have completed the task! 👏

Withdrawing from Nervos Layer 2 is a two step process, first the withdrawal is initiated with the `withdraw` command, and then it is later unlocked with the `unlock` command after the five day challenge period. Executing the `unlock` command is part of the next task.
