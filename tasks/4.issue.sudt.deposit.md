# 4. Issue an SUDT Token on Layer 1 and Deposit it to Layer 2

In this task, we create a token on [Layer 1](../concept-explainers/structure.md#layer-1--layer-2), then move it to the EVM compatible [Layer 2](../concept-explainers/structure.md#layer-1--layer-2). The token on Layer 1 will use the [SUDT](../concept-explainers/standards.md#sudt) standard, which is the most basic form of asset on Nervos. When the token is moved to Layer 2, it is exchanged for an [ERC20](../concept-explainers/standards.md#erc20) token, which is the most popular token standard on blockchains that support the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

The reason that ERC20 tokens are used on Layer 2 is that this ensures full compatibility with EVM smart contracts. Existing smart contracts that are designed to use ERC20 tokens will continue to work without modification. Because the EVM Layer 2 is based on optimistic rollups, any dApp built on Nervos will immediately gain higher TPS with dramatically lower fees for all their users.

In the future, support for other blockchains, such as Cardano, Polkadot, and Stellar, can be added. This enables Nervos to support smart contracts from virtually any platform, and all of their respective token standards. All tokens based on any standard will be able to freely move between layers and different execution environments, enabling asset transfer functionality that was previously difficult to impossible on many other platforms.

## Task Instructions

We will start by issuing an SUDT token on Layer 1. To do this, you will need the private key of a Layer 1 account that has been funded with [Testnet](../concept-explainers/structure.md#mainnet--testnet--devnet) CKBytes. You should already have this available from the previous tasks. After you have a funded account, you can use the `sudt-cli` tool to create an SUDT token on the Layer 1 Testnet.

> Note: Your private keys are used to secure your accounts and all the funds and assets contained within. It is important to keep your private keys safe, and to only use them with tools you can trust. However, on these tasks we will only be working with Testnet funds and assets that have no value. You can operate without concern knowing that there is nothing at risk.

### 1. Setup a Layer 1 Account With Funds

The first step is to setup an account with Testnet funds. You can reuse an existing account if you completed this in previous tasks. If you don't have one, you can complete the steps in [this tutorial](../component-tutorials/1.setup.account.in.ckb.cli.md) to do so.

After your account is setup and funded, keep track of your private key and corresponding Testnet address. You will be able to use these with the [sudt-cli](../concept-explainers/tooling.md#sudt-cli) tool to issue a token on Nervos' Layer 1!

### 2. Use the `sudt-cli` Tool to Issue an SUDT Token on Layer 1

The next step is to create an SUDT token on Nervos' Layer 1. This can be done using the `sudt-cli` command line tool. This tool with use your private key to access the funds on the corresponding account to create the SUDT tokens.

You can follow the instructions in [this tutorial](../component-tutorials/2.issue.sudt.cli.md) to use `sudt-cli` to issue and SUDT Token on the Testnet using your Layer 1 private key.

### 3. Setup the Godwoken Examples Tool Package

The next step is to clone the Godwoken Examples tool package and prepare it for use. This tool package contains the code we will need to interact with Godwoken.

You can follow the instructions in [this tutorial](../component-tutorials/3.setup.and.use.account.cli.md) to setup the Godwoken Examples tool package.

### 4. Deposit Layer 1 SUDT Tokens to on Layer 2

To deposit your SUDT tokens to Layer 2, you will need to execute the following command in `godwoken-examples` directory. Replace the `<VARIABLES>` in the command template below with the values matching your account and node information.

```
node ./packages/tools/lib/account-cli.js deposit-sudt -m 20 -s <INSERT_SUDT_ISSUER_LOCK_HASH> -p <INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY> -l <INSERT_ETH_ADDRESS> -r <INSERT_TESTNET_RPC_URL> -i <INSERT_TESTNET_INDEXER_URL>
```

Variable Description:

1. `<INSERT_SUDT_ISSUER_LOCK_HASH>` - This is the **Issuer Lock Hash** value from SUDT-CLI tool, which is visible after you issue tokens or check the balance. This is the same value as the "SUDT Type Script Args", which you may also see depending on the version of SUDT-CLI you use. If you're unsure how to get it please revisit the [Issue SUDT using command-line interface](../component-tutorials/2.issue.sudt.cli.md) tutorial.
2. `<INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY>` - This is the private key to your Nervos Layer 1 account. The instructions how to get it are in [step 1](4.issue.sudt.deposit.md#1-setup-a-layer-1-account-with-funds) of this tutorial. **Always make sure your private key is prefixed with "0x".**
3. `<INSERT_ETH_ADDRESS>` - The Ethereum address of your account from MetaMask. This will be used to receive funds on Layer 2. This can be found in MetaMask by clicking the address within the wallet as seen below.
4. `<INSERT_TESTNET_RPC_URL>` - The RPC URL of the Testnet CKB node you will use. This should be your local address if you are using a local node, or it can be a public address if you're using a public node.\
   Local Testnet CKB Node URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8114`\
   Public Testnet CKB Node URL: `http://3.235.223.161:18114`
5. `<INSERT_INDEXER_RPC_URL>` - The RPC URL of the Testnet [ckb-indexer](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-indexer) you will use. This should be your local address if you are using a local indexer, or it can be a public address if you're using a public indexer.\
   Local Testnet ckb-indexer URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8116`\
   Public Testnet ckb-indexer URL: `http://3.235.223.161:18116`

Example final command with all values filled in:

```
node ./packages/tools/lib/account-cli.js deposit-sudt -m 20 -s 0x5c7253696786b9eddd34e4f6b6e478ec5742bd36569ec60c1d0487480ba4f9e3 -p 0x79682c20bbcaf7fcf18eb0c69b133c872227ceb88971090e7f2242c80cd54d18 -l 0xD173313A51f8fc37BcF67569b463abd89d81844f -r http://3.235.223.161:18114 -i http://3.235.223.161:18116
```

> Note: The 'account-cli' tool is using [CKB Node](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb) and [ckb-indexer](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-indexer). Make sure both tools are synced with Testnet on the first usage.

Congratulations! You've just deposited your Layer 1 SUDT tokens to your Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 account as ERC20 tokens!

### Potential Errors and Solutions

* If you get the error: `"Not enough capacity in from infos!"` then it means your account on Layer 1 (that you passed access to via private key) doesn't have enough funds to perform an operation.
* If you get the error: `"Not enough amount in from infos!"` then it means you either didn't issue tokens on Layer 1 before running this command, or you've issued less than you want to deposit to Layer 2 now.
