# 1. Create account on the EVM Layer 2 Testnet

Nervos supports the use of Ethereum compatible smart contracts which allow developers to create dApps using the popular Solidity smart contract language. This is done by running the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) in a [Layer 2](../concept-explainers/structure.md#layer-1--layer-2) based execution environment using the [Godwoken](../concept-explainers/frameworks.md#godwoken) and [Polyjuice](../concept-explainers/frameworks.md#polyjuice) frameworks.

EVM dApps run nearly identically on Nervos as they do on Ethereum. This, in turn, allows dApp users to continue using the popular [MetaMask](../concept-explainers/wallets.md#metamask) wallet without having to install anything new. DApp users who are familiar with Ethereum will feel right at home!

## Introduction

In this tutorial you'll create a Godwoken account on Nervos' EVM Layer 2 [Testnet](../concept-explainers/structure.md#mainnet-testnet-devnet). Creating a Godwoken account is the first step that all users must perform on Nervos' [Layer 1](../concept-explainers/structure.md#layer-1--layer-2) blockchain before they can begin interacting with EVM smart contracts on Layer 2.

We will be focusing on Layer 2 in this documentation, so you don't need to think about Layer 1 too much right now. Alright, let's start creating an account!

### 1. Go to "Create Layer 2 Account" tab on CKB Tools website

Start by visiting [dev.ckb.tools/create-layer2-account](https://dev.ckb.tools/create-layer2-account). Make sure MetaMask wallet is installed in your browser and one of the accounts is connected to the page. Click "Create Layer 2 account" button.

### 2. Fund an Account with CKBytes on Layer 1

You have to fund Layer 1 account after you've opened create account modal. It will be the source of funds for Layer 2 deposit. To accomplish this click "COPY TO CLIPBOARD" button to copy your Layer 1 address and then click "GO TO LAYER 1 TESTNET FAUCET".

Paste the copied address into the faucet and click "Claim". If you need more instruction how does the faucet work read [this article](broken-reference).

### 3. Create Layer 2 Account

Make sure the previous step is complete and your Layer 1 account is funded. Proceed to creating Layer 2 account by going back to CKB Tools website and clicking "CREATE ACCOUNT" button in the modal.

You will be asked to sign a message in your wallet. The process will begin after you sign. Your account should be created after few minutes.

* A library that can be integrated into application to programatically create an account: [nervos-godwoken-integration](https://github.com/Roger-Rumblefish/nervos-godwoken-integration) (code examples in readme).
