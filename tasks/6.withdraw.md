# 6. Withdraw From Layer 2 Back to Layer 1

Withdrawing an asset from [Layer 2](../concept-explainers/structure.md#layer-1-layer-2) back to [Layer 1](../concept-explainers/structure.md#layer-1--layer-2) is another step in the roundtrip process of interoperability. [Godwoken](../concept-explainers/frameworks.md#godwoken) is a Layer 2 that is a natural extension of Layer 1, so it has deep integration which allows it to function seamlessly using a built-in withdrawal mechanism.

Deposits from Layer 1 to Layer 2 are quick. This is because Layer 1 has stronger security than Layer 2. When a deposit is made to Layer 2, it can reliably trust Layer 1 after waiting for only a few confirmations. However, a withdrawal is the opposite. When a withdrawal is made to Layer 1, it must rely on Layer 2, which inherently has lower security. For this reason, the number of confirmations required is much higher in order to guarantee that the security remains reliable. It takes approximately five days from the start of the withdrawal process to the point where funds are actually released on Layer 1.

This long withdrawal duration may seem exceptionally long, but it is a necessary step at this stage. Godwoken uses an optimistic rollup architecture that only allows a single honest node in the network. This provides an exceptionally secure basis for Layer 2, but the tradeoff is that it requires a "challenge period" when exiting from Layer 2. This is a period where Layer 2 network operators have time to check and raise issues with any potentially malicious transactions and rollback if necessary. The safety of the network is the first concern. Network parameters may be changed in the future, but only after it has been proven to be safe. It is also possible that other solutions will be created in the future to allow for faster exits from Layer 2.

## Task Instructions

In this task you will use withdraw from your Layer 2 account. This is the first part of the withdrawal process, and the funds must still undergo a five day waiting period before they are unlocked and released. The funds will be unlocked automatically after the waiting period.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin on this task you must complete the [first task](1.create.godwoken.account.md) to create a Godwoken account on the EVM Layer 2 Testnet. If you have not completed it, please do so now.

### 1. Go to "Create Layer 2 Account" tab on CKB Tools website <a href="#1.-go-to-create-layer-2-account-tab-on-ckb-tools-website" id="1.-go-to-create-layer-2-account-tab-on-ckb-tools-website"></a>

Start by visiting [dev.ckb.tools/create-layer2-account](https://dev.ckb.tools/create-layer2-account). Make sure MetaMask wallet is installed in your browser and one of the accounts is connected to the page.

### 2. Submit withdrawal request

Click "Toggle Withdraw view" and then "Create new withdrawal request".

You will see a MetaMask popup:

Click "Sign" to send withdrawal request.

If you see _"Success! Withdrawal request sent."_ message at the end it means you have successfully initiated a withdrawal process. Congratulations, you have completed the task! üëè

You can browse existing withdrawal requests after clicking "Fetch pending withdrawal requests". It might take some time before your new withdrawal request is visible there. It has to be processed by the Layer 1 indexer.

Withdrawing from Nervos Layer 2 is a two step process, first the withdrawal is initiated and then it is later automatically unlocked after the five day challenge period. You don't have to do anything besides waiting if you see your withdrawal request is pending.
