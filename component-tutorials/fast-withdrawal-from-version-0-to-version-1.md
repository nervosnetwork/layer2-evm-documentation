# Fast Withdrawal from Version 0 to Version 1

## Introduction

This tutorial shows how to withdraw funds from old Godwoken - version 0 - to the new network - version 1. If you don't have any funds on old network you should skip this article.

This guide will show you how to do **Fast Withdrawal,** which **takes minutes** instead of days and transfer funds from old Layer 2 EVM Godwoken network to the new Godwoken.

If you wish to withdraw funds from Godwoken V0 to Nervos Layer 1 then it will be a slower process (days) due to Optimistic Rollup security architecture. This guide doesn't cover that.

For additional information regarding the [Godwoken Bridge](https://testnet.bridge.godwoken.io) you can check [docs.godwoken.io](https://docs.godwoken.io/godwokenbridge).

## Withdraw

1. Go to [https://testnet.bridge.godwoken.io/#/v0](https://testnet.bridge.godwoken.io/#/v0) and make sure that in top-right you have "Godwoken V0" network selected:

Wait few minutes and check your balance on Godwoken V1. You can do this by switching network selector in top right to "Godwoken V1" and checking "Deposit" or "Withdraw" view.

Your withdraw transaction might be displayed in "Pending" or "Completed" tab. If you don't see your transaction you can try switching network to "Godwoken V1" and going to "Deposit" view. It might be shown there.

Overall the whole process should take less than five minutes. If you completed all the steps above and you see your funds on Godwoken V1 then congratulations! You have successfully completed this tutorial and bridged your funds.
